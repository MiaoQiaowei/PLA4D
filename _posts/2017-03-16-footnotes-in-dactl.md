dactl uses [Barefoot](https://github.com/philgruneich/barefoot) plugin to create nice looking inline footnotes from those generated by [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/), daktl's markdown processor.
Read on for more information about how to add footnotes to your posts and how to enable/disable Barefoot plugin.

## What is Barefoot.js
I really like the look of inline-footnotes created by [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) but it requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and loading whole library just to have footnotes seems excessive.

I found [Barefoot.js](https://github.com/philgruneich/barefoot) when looking for an alternative an it does exactly what it says:

>Barefoot is a lightweight [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) alternative written in vanilla Javascript to create beautiful inline footnotes.  
Barefoot grabs the common markup used for footnotes on the web, mostly generated by Markdown processors, and transform it into beautiful and meaningful footnotes.

For dactl's purposes I have modified Barefoot's default stylesheet:
* Adjusted the visuals a bit
* Footnote buttons show an icon, not a number
* Necessary changes to make it work with theme switcher
